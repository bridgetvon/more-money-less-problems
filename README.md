  # Description
 ```
 GIVEN a budget tracker without an internet connection
 WHEN the user inputs an expense or deposit
 THEN they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit
 WHEN the user reestablishes an internet connection
 THEN the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated
 ```

  ## User Story :book:
  ```
 AS AN avid traveler
 I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
 SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling 
  ```

  ## Installation Instructions :hammer_and_wrench:
  No installation, simply navigate to the deployed application

  ## Usage Instructions
  Users can track their spending by adding costs and subtracting payments. If the user loses internet connection they are still able to keep track of their data because it is saved to the cache if they lose internet connection. The app is also downloadable as a PWA, so users can add it to their home screen.
